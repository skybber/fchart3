- [x] Add requirements.txt
- [x] Planet, planet moons lookup by name
- [x] Add star/object lookup by common designations:
  - Bayer/Flamsteed (e.g., “Alpha Her”, “51 Peg”)
  - 3-letter Greek abbreviations (e.g., “Ups And”)
  - HIP identifiers (e.g., “HIP123456”)
- [x] move DSO search to search_object_utils.py (new TargetType)
- [x] Refactor switches and add consistent short variants for frequently used options (e.g., -fov, -w, -h, etc.).
- [x] Add `-comet` `-track-from` `-track-to` to cmdline
- 

- [ ] Add minor planet lookup/target by name
- [ ] Expand CLI documentation beyond --help (usage patterns, common workflows, end-to-end examples for “recurring map pipelines”).
- [ ] Fish-eye projection
- [ ] Expose projection selection in CLI/config (discoverability + documented list of supported projections).
- [ ] Clearly define and document the reference epoch used for maps/grids (J2000 vs “date”), and what “epoch around 2016” refers to.
- [ ] Optionally mask/cut objects below horizon.
- [ ] Support dynamic loading of Stellarium skyculture data (discover and load skycultures/.../index.json from a configured Stellarium path).
- [ ] describe creation of horizontal maps "View towards west" etc. with --time argument and planets. Moon enlarged with phase figure?
- [ ] --sidereal-time setting to draw map in horizontal system, optionally with horizon line, without planets
- [ ] resolve crash when plotting planet target with --show_horizontal_grid 
- [ ] (describe how to) create asteroid/comet path plots (skyfield, compute ephemeris sequence, draw trail with date marks; comet could show tail icon pointing away from sun)
- [ ] When plotting in horizontal coordinates, a plotted equatorial grid has its lines clipped within image frame.
- [ ] Ecliptical and galactical grids/plot orientation
- [ ] widget for combined time+position
- [ ] Refraction, extinction in horizontal maps
- [ ] Stacked config files: call --config-file several times, each overriding settings from the previous, e.g. process one for colors, one for field-dependent magnitude limits and labeling settings, grid/coord types, dso catalogs, ...
