- [ ] Expand CLI documentation beyond --help (usage patterns, common workflows, end-to-end examples for “recurring map pipelines”).
- [ ] Refactor switches and add consistent short variants for frequently used options (e.g., -fov, -w, -h, etc.).
- [ ] Fish-eye projection
- [ ] Add `-comet` `-track-from` `-track-to` to cmdline
- [ ] Expose projection selection in CLI/config (discoverability + documented list of supported projections).
- [ ] Add star/object lookup by common designations:
    - Bayer/Flamsteed (e.g., “Alpha Her”, “51 Peg”)
    - 3-letter Greek abbreviations (e.g., “Ups And”)
    - HIP identifiers (e.g., “HIP123456”)
- [ ] Clearly define and document the reference epoch used for maps/grids (J2000 vs “date”), and what “epoch around 2016” refers to.
- [ ] Optionally mask/cut objects below horizon.
- [ ] Support dynamic loading of Stellarium skyculture data (discover and load skycultures/.../index.json from a configured Stellarium path).
